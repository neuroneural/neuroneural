Description:
  
BackgroundDeep learning analytic approaches have made inroads into the brain imaging field, but they are still relatively new and the specific applications which can benefit from such models are not yet fully developed. In this talk I will present some work in which we have developed deep learning models with application to structural and functional brain imaging data in mental illness including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Huntington’s disease.MethodsWe apply and discuss several recent deep learning models which were developed for application to brain imaging data. The first model is focused on structural MRI data, the second on fMRI data, and the third on functional and structural data integration. We then demonstrate performance of these models on several multi-site studies of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Huntington’s disease.ResultsResults provide strong evidence for the potential of deep …
