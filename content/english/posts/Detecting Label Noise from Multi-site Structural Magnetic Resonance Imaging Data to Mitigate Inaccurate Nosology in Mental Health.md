Description:
  
BackgroundCategorizing mental disorders is typically based on symptom-based measures which have large overlaps in clinical symptoms and biological measures among different diagnosis groups. Inaccurate labeling decreases reliability of approaches which build models based on input categorized data. Understanding and addressing this issue is important to improve diagnostic classification.MethodsWe used a novel classification-voting filtering method to identify mislabeled subjects based on a structural MRI dataset. We applied an ANOVA F-value feature selection for dimension reduction and grid search for hyper-parameters optimization. We used iterative support vector machine classification voting filtering to detect label noise by classifying structural MRI (sMRI) data multiple times with the cross-validation stage. New model trained using remaining cleansed data and suggested new labels for misclassified â€¦
