Description:
  
Mental health diagnostic approaches are seeking to identify biological markers to work alongside advanced machine learning approaches. It is difficult to identify a biological marker of disease when the traditional diagnostic labels themselves are not necessarily valid.We worked with T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 1493 individuals comprising healthy control subjects, patients with psychosis, and their unaffected first-degree relatives. Specifically, the dataset included 176 bipolar disorder probands, 134 schizoaffective disorder probands, 240 schizophrenia probands, 362 control subjects, and 581 patient relatives. We assumed that there might be noise in the diagnostic labeling process. We detected label noise by classifying the data multiple times using a support vector machine classifier, and then we flagged those individuals in which all classifiers unanimously â€¦
