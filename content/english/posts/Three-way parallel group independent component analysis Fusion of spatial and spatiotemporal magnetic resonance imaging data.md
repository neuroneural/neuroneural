Description

Advances in imaging acquisition techniques allow multiple imaging modalities to be collected from the same subject. Each individual modality offers limited yet unique views of the functional, structural, or dynamic temporal features of the brain. Multimodal fusion provides effective ways to leverage these complementary perspectives from multiple modalities. However, the majority of current multimodal fusion approaches involving functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are limited to 3D feature summaries that do not incorporate its rich temporal information. Thus, we propose a novel three‐way parallel group independent component analysis (pGICA) fusion method that incorporates the first‐level 4D fMRI data (temporal information included) by parallelizing group ICA into parallel ICA via a unified optimization framework. A new variability matrix was defined to capture subject‐wise functional variability and then …
