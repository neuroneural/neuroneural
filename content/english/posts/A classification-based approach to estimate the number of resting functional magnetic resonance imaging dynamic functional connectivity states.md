Aim: To determine the optimal number of connectivity states in dynamic functional connectivity analysis.Introduction: Recent work has focused on the study of dynamic (vs. static) brain connectivity in resting functional magnetic resonance imaging data. In this work, we focus on temporal correlation between time courses extracted from coherent networks called functional network connectivity (FNC). Dynamic FNC is most commonly estimated using a sliding window-based approach to capture short periods of FNC change. These data are then clustered to estimate transient connectivity patterns or states. Determining the number of states is a challenging problem. The elbow criterion is one of the widely used approaches to determine the connectivity states.Materials and Methods: In our work, we present an alternative approach that evaluates classification (e.g., healthy controls [HCs] vs. patients) as a measure to â€¦
