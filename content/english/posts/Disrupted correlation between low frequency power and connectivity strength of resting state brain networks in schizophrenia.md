Description:
  
Altered brain connectivity has emerged as a central feature of schizophrenia. Low frequency oscillations and connectivity strength (CS) of resting state brain networks are altered in patients with schizophrenia (SZs). However, the relationship between these two measures has not yet been studied. Such work may be helpful in understanding the so-called “rich club” organization (i.e. high-CS nodes are more densely connected among themselves than are nodes of a lower CS in the human brain) in healthy controls (HCs) and SZs. Here we present a study of HCs and SZs examining low frequency oscillations and CS by first decomposing resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) data into independent components (ICs) using group independent component analysis (ICA) and computing the low frequency power ratio (LFPR) of each ICA time course. Weighted brain graphs consisting of ICs were built based on correlations between …
