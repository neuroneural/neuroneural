Description:
  
BackgroundSchizophrenia (SZ) can be distinguished by functional disconnectivity or abnormal integration between distant brain regions. A complete research program needs to integrate both aspect of disconnectivity and integration that may happen among the brain regions. By using a Gaussian graphical model approach, we identified ‘missing’connections between multimodal data and the disconnectors associated with them in SZ. In the present study we explored the added connections in the SZ data.MethodsWe analyzed data from the fBIRN study that included fMRI, dMRI, and sMRI including147 healthy subjects and 147 SZ patients. We estimated the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, fractional anisotropy, and gray matter maps as input features. We applied three-way pICA to these features. We used a joint estimator to extract graphs for healthy and SZ. We then used the concept of connected …
