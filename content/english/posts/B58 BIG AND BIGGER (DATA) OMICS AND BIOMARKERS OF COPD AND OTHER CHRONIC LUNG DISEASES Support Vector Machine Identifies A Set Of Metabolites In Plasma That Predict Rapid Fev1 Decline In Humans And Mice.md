Description:
  
Background: Although extrinsic factors such as age, gender, drug use, or diet can affect metabolic profiles, metabolic alterations in the blood are associated with disease progression. The goal of this study was to identify metabolic biomarkers that are associated with lung function decline in humans. Because we found that loss of Bik, a Bcl-2 family protein, causes the development of enhanced emphysema as mice age, we investigated whether a common set of metabolites could predict both rapid FEV1 decline in humans and in bik-/-mice.Methods: Plasma samples were from 60 each Hispanic (Hisp) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants of the Lovelace Smokers Cohort (LSC). Thirty one NHW rapid decliners (RDs)(mean decline rate 137 ml/year) were matched to 29 NHW non-decliners (NDs)(mean change rate+ 15 ml/year). Thirty Hisp RDs (mean decline rate 78 ml/year) were matched to 30 Hisp NDs (mean â€¦
