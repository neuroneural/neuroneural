Description:
  
Most existing spatiotemporal multi-dipole approaches for MEG/EEG source localization assume that the dipoles are active for the full time range being analysed. If the actual time range of activity of sources is significantly shorter than the time range being analysed, the detectability, localization and time-course determination of such sources may be adversely affected, especially for weak sources. In order to improve detectability and reconstruction of such sources, it is natural to add active time range information (starting time point and ending time point of source activation) for each candidate source as unknown parameters in the analysis. However, this adds additional nonlinear free parameters that could burden the analysis and could be unfeasible for some methods. Recently, we described a spatiotemporal Bayesian inference multi-dipole analysis for the MEG/EEG inverse problem. This approach treated the â€¦
