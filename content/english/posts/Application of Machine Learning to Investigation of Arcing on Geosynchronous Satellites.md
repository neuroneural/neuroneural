Description

The harsh space environment at geosynchronous orbit (GEO) induces differential charging of spacecraft surfaces due to fluxes of high energy electrons onto and through them. Thus, satellite surfaces can charge thousands of volts with respect to each other whereas entire satellites can charge tens of thousands of volts negative of their surrounding space plasma. The ensuing electric fields can cause local discharges (arcs), endangering the normal operation of the satellite. Remote detection of spacecraft arcing is important for the satellite operators in order to properly respond to anomalies caused by spacecraft charging due to the space weather conditions. However, analysis of satellite data is laborious due to the amount of data generated. In this work, we explored the application of machine learning for analysis of GEO satellite arcing behavior using the radio frequency observations by the Arecibo 305 m telescope.
