Description:
  
ObjectivesOpen data sharing for large-scale studies is an expensive and resource-wasteful approach that does not scale well with participating sites. Critically, some data simply cannot be shared due to privacy concerns and/or risk of re-identification. We pursue distributed computation that only shares data derivatives, such as statistical summaries, as a notable alternative allowing data holders to maintain control over data access. Privacy protection, if implemented via the differential privacy framework, can quantify and controllably reduce the risk of sharing the results of computations on private data. Unfortunately, it can impair the quality of statistical estimates at a single site. Using structural MRI data we present a distributed differentially private classifier that greatly improves the accuracy.MethodsWe used a combined MRI dataset from four separate schizophrenia studies conducted at Johns Hopkins University â€¦
