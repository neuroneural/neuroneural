# Introduction to Deep Learning

Welcome to the introduction to deep learning course!
​
This course is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in the
fundamentals of deep learning. Throughout this course, you will learn
about the basic building blocks of deep learning, including basics of
machine learning, convolutional neural networks, and natural language
processing. You will also gain an understanding of how deep learning
algorithms are used to solve a variety of real-world problems, such as
image classification, natural language processing and a few advance
approaches such as GANs.
​

By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of the core concepts and techniques used in deep learning, as well as hands-on experience building and training your own deep learning models using popular frameworks such as PyTorch and Catalyst
​

Dr. Sergey Plis is the instructor for this course, bringing his
expertise of an active researcher in the fields of neuroscience and
computer science. He has extensive experience applying machine
learning algorithms to the analysis of brain imaging data. He is also
an experienced educator, having taught numerous courses in data
science, machine learning, and deep learning at the graduate and
undergraduate levels.
​

The hands-on part of the course has been developed by Mrinal Mathur, a
seasoned machine learning engineer with experience building and
deploying machine learning models for a variety of industries. Mrinal
has a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical and
statistical concepts that power deep learning algorithms, and he has a
passion for teaching others about the exciting possibilities of this
field.
​

Together, we have designed a comprehensive and engaging course that
will provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to succeed in
the exciting field of deep learning.
