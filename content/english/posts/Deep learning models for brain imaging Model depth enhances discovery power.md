Description:
  
Deep learning methods are breaking records in the areas of speech, signal, image, video and text mining and recognition by improving state of the art classification accuracy by, sometimes, more than 30% where the prior decade struggled to obtain a 1-2% improvements [1]. These are very important tasks for brain imaging and neuroscience discovery. In this work we demonstrate our results in application of deep learning methods to brain imaging data from schizophrenia and Huntington disease studies. Our results show: automatic feature learning and model depth enable detection of latent relations in neuroimaging data and improve discriminative power.
