Description:
  
Brain network interactions are commonly assessed via functional (network) connectivity, captured as an undirected matrix of Pearson correlation coefficients. Functional connectivity can represent static and dynamic relations, but often these are modeled using a fixed choice for the data window Alternatively, deep learning models may flexibly learn various representations from the same data based on the model architecture and the training task. However, the representations produced by deep learning models are often difficult to interpret and require additional posthoc methods, e.g., saliency maps. In this work, we integrate the strengths of deep learning and functional connectivity methods while also mitigating their weaknesses. With interpretability in mind, we present a deep learning architecture that exposes a directed graph layer that represents what the model has learned about relevant brain connectivity. A â€¦
