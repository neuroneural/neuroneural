Description:
  
Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analysis is a widely used approach for capturing brain activation patterns, connectivity states, and network organization. However, a typical sliding window plus clustering (SWC) approaches for analyzing dFNC continuously models the system through a fixed set of connectivity patterns or states. It assumes these patterns are span throughout the brain, but in practice, they are more spatially constrained and temporally short-lived. Thus, SWC is not designed to capture transient dynamic changes nor heterogeneity across subjects/time. Here, we adapt time series motifs to model the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity. We propose a state-space data mining approach that combines a probabilistic pattern summarization framework called ‘Statelets’ — a subset of high dimensional state-shape prototypes capturing the dynamics. We handle scale differences using the earth mover distance and utilize kernel density estimation to build a probability density profile for local motifs. We apply the framework to study dFNC collected from patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy control (HC). Results demonstrate SZ subjects exhibit reduced modularity in their brain network organization relative to HC. These statelets in the HC group show more recurrence across the dFNC time-course compared to the SZ. An analysis of the consistency of the connections across time reveals significant differences within visual, sensorimotor, and default mode regions where HC subjects show higher consistency than SZ. The introduced statelet-approach also enables the handling of dynamic information in cross-modal …
