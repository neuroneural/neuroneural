Description:
  
The field of neuroimaging has recently witnessed a strong shift towards data sharing; however, current collaborative research projects may be unable to leverage institutional architectures that collect and store data in local, centralized data centers. Additionally, though research groups are willing to grant access for collaborations, they often wish to maintain control of their data locally. These concerns may stem from research culture as well as privacy and accountability concerns. In order to leverage the potential of these aggregated larger data sets, we require tools that perform joint analyses without transmitting the data. Ideally, these tools would have similar performance and ease of use as their current centralized counterparts. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new Algorithm, decentralized joint independent component analysis (djICA), which meets these technical requirements. djICA shares only â€¦
