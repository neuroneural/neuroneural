Description:
  
Most causal learning algorithms for time series data assume that the underlying generative process operates on approximately the same timescale as the measurement process (or that any differences do not impede learning). This assumption fails in many domains, and so we first show that undersampling creates learning challenges at the measurement timescale, even for simple generative processes. We then describe four algorithmic generalizations (some previously proposed, none previously tested)—two for continuous data, and two for either continuous or discrete data—and test them on simulated data. The results suggest that measurement timescale structure learning from undersampled time series data is feasible, but the appropriate model class needs to be used. Moreover, explicitly representing the possibility of undersampling can yield valuable regularization benefits.
