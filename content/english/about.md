## Sergey Plis <br> <strong>Assiociate Professor of CS at GSU</strong>

I received my Ph.D.  degree in Computer Science in 2007 from The
University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.  Currently, I am an
associate professor of CS at Georgia State University, and the
Director of Machine Learning core at the TReNDS institute.  My
research interests within the fields of machine learning, AI, and data
science lie in developing novel and applying existing techniques and
approaches to analyzing large scale datasets.  One of my key goals is
to take advantage of the strengths of multiple data modalities and
infer structure and patterns that are hard to obtain non-invasively
and/or that are unavailable for direct observation. Ongoing work is
focused on inferring multimodal probabilistic and causal descriptions
based on fusion of fast and slow imaging modalities. This includes
feature estimation via deep learning-based pattern recognition and
learning causal graphical models.  Besides academia, I've led AI
research teams developing deep tech AI products including NLP and
speech processing solutions that are currently shipped to customers.
My research is supported by generous grants from NSF and NIH.
