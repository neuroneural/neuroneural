description: "I am a third year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Georgia Institute of Technology. My area of research incudes Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Causal Learning. I work on developing novel machine learning methods to extract causal relations among complex and big scale data from time series. Currently I am working on a new method for causal structure discovery. I improved state-of-the-art run-time by three orders of magnitude by re-defining the problem as constraint optimization and solving using Answer Set Programming. This method is used in understanding causal relations of the brain from fMRI data, as well as simulated data."
