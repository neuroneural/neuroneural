description: "I am a Ph.D. student at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am primarily interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, focusing in the areas of sparsity in deep learning, efficient ML and optimization. Currently, I am working on developing novel methods of inducing sparsity in deep neural networks and studying the effects it has in the models. More recently, I have also started working in the areas of sparse reinforcement learning and multi-task learning."
