## My research interest includes:

1. 1. Computer Vision
2. Natural Language Generation/Understanding
3. Multimodal Understanding
4. Reinforcement Learning
5. Causal/Counterfactual modelling
6. Time Series Forecasting
7. Multitask Learning

I am pursuing Masters in Computer Science (specializing in Machine Learning) under Dr. Sergey Plis.

I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for 3 years at ARM, where i was a part of Machine Learning group working in the [Arm’s Machine Learning Research Lab](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arm.com%2Fresources%2Fresearch%2Fml&data=04%7C01%7Cjtaylor236%40gsu.edu%7Cc6b99b0b93fb4eeebd8d08d9dbac1251%7C515ad73d8d5e4169895c9789dc742a70%7C0%7C0%7C637782354367817234%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=LzCVojyZd3Xkz7kBhkhvefLop3xhw2Hvx5QC2dqXWKw%3D&reserved=0) under [Parth Maj](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.arm.com%2Fmembers%2Fpartha-maji%3F_ga%3D2.57019631.452265166.1642637457-1646604295.1642637457%26_gac%3D1.61305310.1642637471.Cj0KCQiAip-PBhDVARIsAPP2xc3vjtqxFkzhnkegQNr2dZBlp_VSXQS389S4_GizIiIFcdAcx0z6ockaAtpJEALw_wcB&data=04%7C01%7Cjtaylor236%40gsu.edu%7Cc6b99b0b93fb4eeebd8d08d9dbac1251%7C515ad73d8d5e4169895c9789dc742a70%7C0%7C0%7C637782354367817234%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=K8WHoi1ucDICURrd7NWNexQ0rnDPCxi6%2FIRPvI2xXRI%3D&reserved=0) where we worked on many Deep Learning problems thath were used to train, optimize and accelerate NPU chips.

I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science in 2018 from Manipal Institute of Technology, where I was advised by Dr. [Chetna Sharma](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmanipal.edu%2Fmit%2Fdepartment-faculty%2Ffaculty-list%2Fchethan-sharma%2F_jcr_content.html&data=04%7C01%7Cjtaylor236%40gsu.edu%7Cc6b99b0b93fb4eeebd8d08d9dbac1251%7C515ad73d8d5e4169895c9789dc742a70%7C0%7C0%7C637782354367817234%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=gpBTQYoFnJtSOFJU%2BVf2MC7A%2B486SY7j1ykp2IYwGmM%3D&reserved=0). and worked on my thesis “Resume Parser for Blockchain Profile Using Novel Deep Learning”
