description: "My research is primarily focussed on applying deep learning neural networks to neuroimaging data. My current research is focussed on using pre-trained models trained on time direction of FMRI data to predict and classify different abnormalities in the brain. We believe such pertained models could help learn better the brain functions. Recurrent Neural Networks work well with time series data. The goal is to develop models by exploiting the capabilities of RNNS and observe their performance on benchmark medical datasets."
